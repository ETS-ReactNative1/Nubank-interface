#### Recreating the main animation of the Nubank app using React Native <img src="https://github.com/VitorHugoAntunes/Nubank-interface/blob/master/src/assets/react-native.png" alt="react-native" height="18">.

<hr>

To open the project on your phone run `react-native run-android` on the terminal (you need to enable USB debugging) or have the emulator configured on your PC, the same for Iphone, but using `react-native run-ios`.</br></br>

The interface is not entirely identical, but it was possible to have a very similar result using React Native with native animations, having fluidity in the application.</br>
The construction of the interface was based on the tutorial by [Diego Fernandes](https://github.com/diego3g), CTO of [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).
