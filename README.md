#### Recreating the main animation of the Nubank app using React Native <img src="https://github.com/VitorHugoAntunes/Nubank-interface/blob/master/src/assets/react-native.png" alt="react-native" height="18">.

<hr>

To open the project on your phone run `react-native run-android` on the terminal (you need to enable USB debugging) or have the emulator configured on your PC, the same for Iphone, but using `react-native run-ios`.</br></br>

### The project was created using the RocketSeat template:
- `react-native init nubankInterface --template rocketseat-basic`;

### Installed packages, frameworks and dependencies :
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/getting-started.html) (follow additional steps for android);
- [React Native Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons);
- [React Native Iphone X Helper](https://github.com/ptelad/react-native-iphone-x-helper) (only for IOS);
- [React Native QRCode SVG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-qrcode-svg);

**Note: the other dependencies were installed automatically when creating the project, except for some personal ESLint settings.**

The interface is not entirely identical, but it was possible to have a very similar result using React Native with native animations, having fluidity in the application.</br>
The construction of the interface was based on the tutorial by [Diego Fernandes](https://github.com/diego3g), CTO of [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).
